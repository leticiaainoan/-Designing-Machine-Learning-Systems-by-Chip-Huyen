# -Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-by-Chip-Huyen

My name is: Leticia Ainoan Nunes de Sousa

This is an assignment for the Machine Learning course
contains a series of video summaries for the first five chapters of the book Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen. My goal is to create short and clear videos that highlight the key points of each chapter, helping to understand the core concepts of machine learning systems.

**Project Description:**

There are five videos, each covering a specific chapter of the book.
- Each video is up to 5 minutes long and focuses on the key insights and ideas of the chapter.
- This project is an opportunity to consolidate knowledge about the design of machine learning systems and to develop skills in communicating technical concepts.

**Chapter 1: Overview of Machine Learning Systems**
